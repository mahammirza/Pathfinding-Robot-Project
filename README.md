# Pathfinding-Robot-Project
The Pathfinding Robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and adjust its movement in real-time. If something gets too close, it stops, turns, and reroutes. Powered by Arduino and DC motors, it moves forward when clear and slows down when needed. It also outputs distance data to the serial monitor, making navigation smart and efficient. ðŸ¤–
